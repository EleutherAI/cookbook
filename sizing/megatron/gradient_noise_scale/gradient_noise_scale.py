class GradientNoiseScale:
    """
    A class to measure the gradient noise scale of a model while training (cf. https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06162).

    The core thesis of the paper is that, if our batch size is small, there will be a lot of noise present in the gradients, and we might update our weights only on noise.
    After several updates the optimizer may still push us in the right direction, but we would be better off having used a larger batch size, which is more computationally
    efficient and directly averages out the noise in the gradients.

    But there's a limit to the gains large batch sizes can give you - if, after a certain batch size, your gradient is already accurate, there's no point in increasing the
    batch size further, as we'll just be wasting compute for little to no gain in accuracy.

    This means there is some theoretically optimal batch size for a given model, which measuring the gradient noise scale can help us to estimate.

    To estimate the 'simple' noise scale (Bsimple), we need to have a measure of the gradients using a large batch size (Bbig) and a small
    batch size (Bsmall).

    when we have those:
        Bsimple ≈ (tr(Σ) / |G|^2)

    tr(Σ) can be approximated by:
        tr(Σ) ≈ (1 / ((1/Bsmall) - (1/Bbig))) * (|Gsmall|^2 - |Gbig|^2)

    and |G|^2 by:
        |G|^2 ≈ (1 / (Bbig - Bsmall)) * (Bbig*|Gbig|^2 - Bsmall*|Gsmall|^2)

    - With multi-gpu training, we can do this by taking the gradients of the microbatch_size_per_gpu for Bsmall,
    and the gradients of the entire batch for Bbig.
    - Alternatively, we can just take Bsmall as a single batch, and Bbig as several sequential batches in a row.
    This is the option we've opted for in this implementation because a) it's easier to implement and b) also works in
    single-gpu environments. Unfortunately it does come with some memory overhead.
